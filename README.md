# 42-exam_04

This repository contains my solutions for the 42 School exam_04.   
At the time I passed it, it was required to do :   
- microshell   

It is a simplified version of minishell where you have to do a little bit of parsing, implement a simplified version of the "cd" command and handle the execution.
Here is my solution to the problem.
Feel free to have a look at it but please practice before the exam in order to learn how the logic works :)
